			<p>The axolotl, also known as a Mexican salamander is originated from Xochimilco lake in Mexico City. These amphibians can reach adulthood without undergoing metamorphosis.
			The axolotl has the unique capability of regenerating different parts of its body in case they are lost or damaged, and it can regenerate missing limbs, kidney, heart, or lungs.
